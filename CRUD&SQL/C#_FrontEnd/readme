#🔎 Overview

This repository contains a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with C# in Visual Studio. 
The project demonstrates how to integrate SQL Server using both SQLDataClient for direct database connectivity and Entity Framework for ORM‑based data management. 
It serves as a practical example of combining low‑level ADO.NET operations with high‑level Entity Framework abstractions to build scalable and maintainable applications.
